<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
  I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in Finance with a certificate in Pre-Health Sciences. I grew up in Chicago, IL with my parents, my older sister, and all sorts of stuffed animals. I love my family, friends, baking, and all-day movie marathons! </p>
  
  
<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
  I can usually be found playing with puppies, working at the clinic, somewhere at a park, or, from time-to-time, running around grocery stores. My favorite foods include homemade brownies, baby carrots, and COFFEE!!! The way to my heart is a dark chocolate and hugs <3 !  </p>
